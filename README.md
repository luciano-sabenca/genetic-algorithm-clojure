# Genetic Algorithm in Clojure

A very simple implementation of a genetic algorithm in Clojure.
It was created for academic purpose only, so it was not designed to have a great performance.

The implementation is under the namespace `genetic_algorithm`. 
You can see a simple demo at `demo` folder.



## Demo

The demo is a stock recomendation problem: given a limited budget, how can I invest it on stocks for long-term (i.e. stable stocks)?

The data used to simulate is from S&P ranking from 2010 and the benchmarks and stability metrics were created just to test the algorithm.

You can find an academic report about this implementation and demo on "relatorio.pdf" **(portuguese only!!)**


## Execution 

This project uses Leinigen, so it is very recommended its use. 
To run a series of basic examples just run:
`lein run`


To run with custom parameters you should run the following commands:


`lein repl`

And

`(-main [100 0.2 0.8 10])`


The first parameter is the size of population, the second is the mutation rate, the third is the crossover rate and the last ont the population' size.

It was an done as a academic undergraduate assignment at University of Campinas (UNICAMP)
